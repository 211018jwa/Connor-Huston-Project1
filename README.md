# Features

List of features that are ready:

* Users are ready to sign in and out as employees or finance manager
* Employees can add a reimbursement by filling out the following steps provided on the homepage.
* Finance Managers can see employee's reimbursements and can either approve or deny the reimbursement by clicking on the approve or deny button.
* Employees can later see the results left by the finance manager to see if their reimburesement has been approved or denied. Or if their reimburesement has yet to have a status.

List of to-do's to improve this project:

* Images need to improve the sizes so both employee and finance manager can see the actual image.
* Some selenium testing needs to be work when adding a new reimbursement or approving or denying a reimbursement.
* Add a sign-up page for the front-end, even though the programmer can do that through the backend.
